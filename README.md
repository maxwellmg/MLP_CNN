The purpose of this program is to get some experience with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks using the Tensorflow library and Keras. 

The outset goals are to work on learning Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing with image and text classification. These models are built on the Fashion MNIST and 20 Newsgroups datasets.
Fashion: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist
Newsgroups: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/20-newsgroups

The Image Classification Program:

Uses the Fashion MNIST dataset.
With it, I:
1. transform the images into a vector representation appropriate for MLP
2. transform the images into a tensor representation for a 2D-CNN for both train and test sets
3. train an MLP network on the 1D training set
4. train a CNN on the 2D training set
5. finally, the accuracy of the two models are evaluated in a table

Text Classification Program:
Use the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
With it, I:
1. create a tf-idf vector representation for the text data to compress it
2. the divide the data, at random, into training, testing, and validation sets (60-20-20 split)
3. create an initial MLP as a baseline, then a second MLP model to optimize hyperparameters
4. after adjusting the second model, I test the baseline model and optimized model on the test set
5. finally, I report the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-measures for both models.
